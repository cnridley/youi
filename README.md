# YOU&i

You and i is a website built for a personal trainer (Danielle), which has a 
e-commerce store so that she can sell her merchandise, as well 
as a client login which gives her clients a personalized client portal in which 
Danielle can upload their workouts weekly and they can upload progression pictures, weekly measurements
and any comments that they might have.
You&i also contains a gallery so that Danielle is able to advertise her private studio and a review page so that anyone 
can leave a review. 
The website also contains a contact form, that is linked to Danielles e-mail, this is how potential clients contact Danielle
to discuss workout plan options - only Danielle has the ability to create a new user. 

### When no one is logged in:
* only the 'galley', 'merchandise', 'contact', 'client login' and 'reviews' link will be visible on the web page.

### Danielle is the superuser, when she is logged in she has the ability to:
* Register new clients that have contacted her to set up a workout plan. 
* Delete any reviews that she does not like - this is done with a delete button on each review that is only visible
when a superuser is logged in. 
* Edit and delete any of the merchandise - this is done with a edit button which takes
Danielle to a new page and delete button on each review that is only visible
when a superuser is logged in. 
* Upload new workouts for the clients - this is done by logging into the admin page. 

### When clients are logged in:
* When they log in they will be automatically re-directed to their personalized client portal.
* They will be able to upload progression pictures, measurements and any comments they have for Danielle via a form which is
rendered to a bootstrap modal.

# UX
When designing this website, I wanted to keep the color scheme that matched her logo (pink and white), whilst keeping it 
easy to navigate for new users and visually appealing to make potential new clients stay on the webpage and naviagte around
the webpage.
